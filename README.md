# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using supervised classification models.

## Contents
- `notebook.ipynb` — complete notebook with EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation
- `submission.csv` — final predictions for test set

## Steps
1. Data exploration
2. Preprocessing & feature engineering
3. Train models (Logistic Regression, RandomForest)
4. Evaluate models (accuracy, precision, recall, f1, confusion matrix)
5. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
6. Final predictions and analysis of bias

## How to run
- Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
- Make sure `train.csv` and `test.csv` are in the working directory.
- Run cells sequentially.
